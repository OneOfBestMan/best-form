# best-form
C# doc-gen

* Parses C# source code to extract the XML documentation as well as a fully tokenised structure of the code itself
* Uses a virtual DOM that is actually a reader monad to project the tokenised structure into API documentation
* Generates HTML that looks very much like the .NET Core docs

See the [language-ext API reference for a demo of this library](https://louthy.github.io/)
